# Ftps
A Git repo made to make you mad. You probably came here thinking someone made a gem for downloading from an FTPS server. That'd be convenient, eh?  

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ftps'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install ftps
```

Then just run:

```
Ftps.download("YOUR SERVER URL")
```

## License
The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
